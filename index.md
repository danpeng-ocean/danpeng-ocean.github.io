# <i class="fa fa-feather-alt fa-fw"></i>&nbsp;About Me

I'm a senior algorithm engineer at the Map Search Group of <a href="https://www.didiglobal.com/">Didi Chuxing</a>. Before joining Didi, I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in June 2018, under the supervision of [Prof. Guihai Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rqZWbYgAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Fan Wu](http://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~fwu/), and my Bachelor degree from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in June 2012. From September 2015 to March 2017, I was a visiting student in the Department of Computer Science at Yale University, hosted by [Prof. Yang (Richard) Yang](http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/yry/). 

I'm currently working on POI Retrieval and Natural Language Processing for mobile transportation systems.

### Deep Query-POI Relevance Model
![](/projects/didi/relevance.jpg){:height="500" width="500"}<br>
We incorporate semantic similarity with geographic correlation to capture comprehensive features for Query-POI relevance analysis.
We capture and represent multi-field and local&global semantic features of Query-POI pairs to measure the semantic similarity, and propose two location embeddings to characterize the hidden locations correlations between the origin-destination pairs.

### Data Quality Based Incentive
![](/projects/sjtu/quality.png){:height="500" width="500"}<br>
We propose to pay the rational participants as how well they do, to motivate them to efficiently perform crowdsensing tasks.

### Location Contribution Based Incentive
![](/projects/sjtu/location.png){:height="500" width="500"}<br>
We design a location contribution weighted incentive mechanism, to direct highly targeted collaboration for crowdsensing participants.

### Distributed Wireless Spectrum Auction
![](/projects/sjtu/distributed.png?v8){:height="500" width="500"}<br>
We design an efficient and faithful distributed mechanism, which achieves sub-optimal social welfare with low overhead.
